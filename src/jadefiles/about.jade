        p.about-text I am a Navy wife and mother of four (and one on the way), two are boys and the other two are furry kids, a cat and black lab. I am originally from Southern Maine but my husband is active duty and transferred to Groton, Ct in 2010. I have been so blessed here and have made some great friends. In my spare time I love to upcycle items I find at flea markets, thrift shops and yard sales, you can see some of some of the fun finds I have come across for my studio throughout the site. I also love fashion and the latest trends which generally leads me to be a huge shopaholic! I am so happy to finally be living my dream of being a full time Makeup Artist. I recently opened my studio and am a fully licensed cosmetology establishment in the state (I can also do on location work). I find a little makeup can really build someoneâ€™s confidence and those are the moments when I love my job the most.
